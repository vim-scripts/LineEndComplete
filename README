DESCRIPTION
The i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L completion completes entire, identical lines. Sometimes,
you need completion of an almost-identical line with differences in indent or
a prefix string.
This plugin provides a completion mapping that takes the base text before the
cursor, and offers the missing parts of other lines that also have this base
text. If you know the exact common text, or to whittle down the number of
matches, you can also select the completion base yourself before invoking the
mapping.

SEE ALSO
- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
In insert mode, invoke the completion via CTRL-X $.
Alternatively, you can pre-select the base (via select or visual mode) before
invoking the completion. This ensures that the best context for completion is
chosen.

You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X $                Find matches starting with the MotionComplete-base
                        text before the cursor, until the end of that line.

{Visual}CTRL-X $        Find matches starting with the selected text, until
                        the end of that line.
